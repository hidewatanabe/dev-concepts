# System Design

1. Optimize processes and increase thoughput with the same resource (vertical scalling)
2. Preparing beforehand at non-peek hours (Preprocessing and cron jobs)
3. Keep backups and avoid single points of failure (Backups)
4. Hire more resources (Horizontal scalling)
5. Microservices architecture (Segregating responsability and lifecycle)
6. Distributed System (Partitions)
7. Load Balancer (Distribuiting traffic)
8. Decoupling (Segregating more responsabilities)
9. Logging and Metrics calculation
10. Extensibility


## High Level Design x Low Level Design
### HLD: Separation of concerns, fault tolerance, more resource,...
### LLD: Code, classes,
